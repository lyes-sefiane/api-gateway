# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A sample workflow which checks out the code, builds a container
# image using Docker and scans that image for vulnerabilities using
# Snyk. The results are then uploaded to GitHub Security Code Scanning
#
# For more examples, including how to limit scans to only high-severity
# issues, monitor images for newly disclosed vulnerabilities in Snyk and
# fail PR checks for new vulnerabilities, see https://github.com/snyk/actions/
